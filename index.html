[h2] You can always count on me when [/h2]

You need help with something I know of, you need a good book recommendation or if you need to be distracted with lots of otherwise useless little factoids on a variety of different subjects

[h2] A funny story [/h2]

As a child, I didn't know all words yet so I tried to fit the things I saw with the words I already knew. This led to the creation of things like "Leg Sleeve" for pants leg.

[h3] TL;DR [/h3]

Leg sleeves are a valid name which should be adopted worldwide
